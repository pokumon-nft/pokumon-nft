# Pokumon NFT

This is an NFT game you raise and fight unique characters generated by AI called Pokumon. The NFT character pick up tokens by Walk and increase its status by Food. If you lose a battle against another player, your Pokumon will never pick up a token again.

# About

This product is an NFT game, but it is designed to be an anti-NFT symbol.
The product consists of AI-based NFT generation, NFT purchase, NFT training, NFT collection, and NFT battles.
However, if you lose the NFT battle, the NFT will not be able to pick up tokens, and their value will be greatly diminished.
Our goal is to create a product that would make people think about the value of NFTs in the current NFT bubble.

# Smart Contract

You can deploy the following commands:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-token.ts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-nft.ts
npx hardhat run scripts/mint-nft.ts
```

You can use the following commands.

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Deep Learning

We created a dataset of all Pokémon that exist, and generated the characters by fine-tuning them with the ruDALL-E model. We used Google Colab for training, which took 2 days. Using the trained model, it took a day to create 1000 Pokumon.

## NFT names [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pokumon-nft/pokumon-nft/blob/main/ai_models/name_generator.ipynb)

By using all the names of Pokémon as a data set and training it with the LSTM model, we were able to automatically generate Pokémon-like names.

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```
